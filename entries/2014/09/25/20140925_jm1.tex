\subsection{The first test in MATLAB}
In this test the first MATLAB implementation is designed and tested. 
It is implemented with $GB$ as the arithmetic mean. This is done to handle the zero-crossing problems. 
\begin{equation}
    GB = \frac{G+G0}{2}    
\end{equation}
Figure \ref{fig:matlab_test_first_gain} shows what goes on when varying the gain $G$ from $-20$ to $20\texttt{dB}$
\input img/matlab_test_first_gain.tex
\todo[inline]{It is needed to change the gain definiton of GB, in order to get the same characteristic in both boost and cut region.}
% The obvious approach is to implement a sign change for boost and cut regions.}
% The part of the label after the colon must match the file name. Otherwise,
% conditional compilation based on task labels does NOT work.
